# Hands-on Kubernetes-05 : Managing Secrets and ConfigMaps

Purpose of the this hands-on training is to give students the knowledge of Kubernetes Secrets and config-map

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this hands-on training, students will be able to;

- Explain the Kubernetes Secrets

- Share sensitive data (such as passwords) using Secrets.

- Learn configuration management for applications in Kubernetes using ConfigMaps.

## Outline

- Part 1 - Setting up the Kubernetes Cluster

- Part 2 - Kubernetes Secrets

- Part 3 - ConfigMaps in Kubernetes

## Part 1 - Setting up the Kubernetes Cluster

- Launch a Kubernetes Cluster of Ubuntu 20.04 with two nodes (one master, one worker) using the [Cloudformation Template to Create Kubernetes Cluster](../kubernetes-02-basic-operations/cfn-template-to-create-k8s-cluster.yml). *Note: Once the master node up and running, worker node automatically joins the cluster.*

>*Note: If you have problem with kubernetes cluster, you can use this link for lesson.*
>https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes/playground

- Check if Kubernetes is running and nodes are ready.

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get no
```

## Part 2 - Kubernetes Secrets

## Creating your own Secrets 

### Creating a Secret Using kubectl

- Secrets can contain user credentials required by Pods to access a database. For example, a database connection string consists of a username and password. You can store the username in a file ./username.txt and the password in a file ./password.txt on your local machine.

```bash
# Create files needed for the rest of the example.
echo -n 'admin' > ./username.txt
echo -n '1f2d1e2e67df' > ./password.txt
```

- The kubectl create secret command packages these files into a Secret and creates the object on the API server. The name of a Secret object must be a valid DNS subdomain name. Show types of secrets with opening : (Kubetnetes Secret Types)[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/]

```bash
kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass --from-file=./username.txt --from-file=./password.txt
```

- The output is similar to:

```bash
secret "db-user-pass" created
```

- Default key name is the filename. You may optionally set the key name using `[--from-file=[key=]source]`.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass-key --from-file=username=./username.txt --from-file=password=./password.txt
```

>Note:
>Special characters such as `$`, `\`, `*`, `=`, and `!` will be interpreted by your shell and require escaping. In most shells, the easiest way to escape the password is to surround it with single quotes (`'`). For example, if your actual password is S!B\*d$zDsb=, you should execute the command this way:
>
>```bash
>kubectl create secret generic dev-db-secret --from-literal=username=devuser --from-literal=password='S!B\*d$zDsb='
>```
>You do not need to escape special characters in passwords from files (--from-file).

- You can check that the secret was created:

```bash
kubectl get secrets
```

- The output is similar to:

```bash
NAME                  TYPE                                  DATA      AGE
db-user-pass          Opaque                                2         51s
```

You can view a description of the secret:

```bash
kubectl describe secrets/db-user-pass
```

Note: The commands kubectl get and kubectl describe avoid showing the contents of a secret by default. This is to protect the secret from being exposed accidentally to an onlooker, or from being stored in a terminal log.

The output is similar to:
```bash
Name:            db-user-pass
Namespace:       default
Labels:          <none>
Annotations:     <none>

Type:            Opaque

Data
====
password.txt:    12 bytes
username.txt:    5 bytes
```

### Creating a Secret manually 

- You can also create a Secret in a file first, in JSON or YAML format, and then create that object. The name of a Secret object must be a valid DNS subdomain name. The Secret contains two maps: data and stringData. The data field is used to store arbitrary data, encoded using base64. The stringData field is provided for convenience, and allows you to provide secret data as unencoded strings.

- For example, to store two strings in a Secret using the data field, convert the strings to base64 as follows:

```bash
echo -n 'admin' | base64
```

- The output is similar to:

```bash
YWRtaW4=
```

```bash
echo -n '1f2d1e2e67df' | base64
```

- The output is similar to:

```bash
MWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm
```

- Write a Secret that looks like this named `secret.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysecret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=
  password: MWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm
```

- Now create the Secret using `kubectl apply`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./secret.yaml
```

- The output is similar to:

```bash
secret "mysecret" created
```

### Decoding a Secret

- Secrets can be retrieved by running kubectl get secret. For example, you can view the Secret created in the previous section by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get secret mysecret -o yaml
```

- The output is similar to:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: MWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm
  username: YWRtaW4=
kind: Secret
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
      {"apiVersion":"v1","data":{"password":"MWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm","username":"YWRtaW4="},"kind":"Secret","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"mysecret","namespace":"default"},"type":"Opaque"}
  creationTimestamp: "2021-10-06T12:51:08Z"
  name: mysecret
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "38986"
  uid: fb55a84e-24f5-461d-a000-e7dab7c34200
type: Opaque
```

- Decode the password field:

```bash
echo 'MWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm' | base64 --decode
```

- The output is similar to:

```bash
1f2d1e2e67df
```

### Using Secrets 

- This is an example of a Pod that uses secrets from environment variables:

- mysecret-pod.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secret-env-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: redis
    env:
      - name: SECRET_USERNAME
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: mysecret
            key: username
      - name: SECRET_PASSWORD
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: mysecret
            key: password
  restartPolicy: Never
```

- Create the pod.

```bash
kubectl apply -f mysecret-pod.yaml
```

### Consuming Secret Values from environment variables

- Inside a container that consumes a secret in an environment variables, the secret keys appear as normal environment variables containing the base64 decoded values of the secret data. This is the result of commands executed inside the container from the example above:

- Enter into pod and type following command.

```bash
kubectl exec -it secret-env-pod -- bash
root@secret-env-pod:/data# echo $SECRET_USERNAME
admin
root@secret-env-pod:/data# echo $SECRET_PASSWORD
1f2d1e2e67df
```
